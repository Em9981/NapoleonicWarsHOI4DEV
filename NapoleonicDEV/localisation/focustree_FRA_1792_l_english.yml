FRA_introduce_conscription_desc:0 "War is raging on our borders, and we need to act fast. The coalition's armies can only be stopped with more revolutionaries on the front. This may spark unpopularity within our rebellious territory, but it is a neccesary change to win the war."

FRA_the_path_ahead_desc:0 "In 1789, we revolted. We saw the power shaky, and ready for the taking. The people took the chance and took it. It has been 3 years since then, and our revolutionary spirit burns brighter than ever. However, the road ahead seems unclear. The conservative and monarchic elements of Europe grows more discontent with our removal of our monarch each day. Something must be done soon. The first elections are soon to be held too, and their importance cannot be understated. We must make sure everything is aligned for our chance, for our soon to be republic."

FRA_press_priests_into_service_desc:0 "The priests who preach their fake god have done nothing for our revolution. They feed off of the common man to further their own goals while living in luxury. It's time to make them a true part of the revolution. We will make them say the oath and fight for our revolution. That will be payment enough for their hundreds of years of disgusting parasitic behaviour."

FRA_abolish_the_monarchy_desc:0 "The traitorous king Louis has been a thorn in our side since his birth. His reign has seen the downwards spiral continue more and more, which led us to start our revolution. It is time to relieve him of his position, and abolish it so no monarch can step foot in France again. This will in turn create our republic. Finally, after so many years of death, war, chaos and turmoil, the republic stands clear, ready to steer into prosperity and victory!"
